# Introduction

*StartSharp* is premium version of our free *Serene* application template.

It includes everything that Serene has, in addition to extra samples, features, integrations and modules.

## Premium Packages

Our premium packages that include *StartSharp* template are available at [http://serenity.is](http://serenity.is). 

Currently, four levels are offered: _Basic_, _Personal_, _Professional_ and _Enterprise_.

They also contain varying levels of premium support, except _Basic_ level which doesn't include support.

Let's first explain what you get with these premium packages.

## Commercial Licence

Serene Template and Serenity itself has a permissive MIT licence which allows usage in open source, commercial and proprietary applications.

*StartSharp*, which is also based on Serenity, comes with a commercial licence, that allows you to use it with any number of commercial applications / sites (except _Basic_ level which allows only one application)

> You are not allowed to use StartSharp content in an open source application as it would mean open sourcing StartSharp itself.

*StartSharp* is licenced per seat / developer. 

_Basic_ and _Personal_ levels comes with one licence, and allows just one developer to use StartSharp. These levels are only suitable for single / freelance developers.

You are allowed to use _Basic_ level licence for only one application / project. If you are planning to write multiple applications, you should consider _Personal_ or higher levels.   

_Professional_ level comes with 3 seats / developers licences, while _Enterprise_ contains 5 seats / developers licences. 

> Even though it is possible to buy multiple _Personal_ licences, we recommend _Professional_ or _Enterprise_ as they are more cost effective.

We also offer volume licencing discounts. Contact us at [sales@serenity.is](mailto:sales@serenity.is) for more information.

## Private Support Desk

You get prioritized e-mail support from our core developers, with guaranteed initial response time of 72 / 48 / 24 hours (excluding weekends and public holidays) based on your support level.

> _Basic_ level doesn't contain any support.

This guranteed response time is for a certain number of issues (as a fair use policy) based on support level:

- _Personal_: 72 hours for first 10 Incidents
- _Professional_: 48 hours for first 15 Incidents
- _Enterprise_: 24 hours for first 20 Incidents

> This doesn't mean you won't receive an answer to your further incidents, response is just not guaranteed within specified time. 

> Initial response time specified excludes weekends and public holidays.

## Live Credits

These are hours that you can use to get direct remote support from our developers. 

We recommend using these credits for troubleshooting, so that you can save your precious hours / days by letting us handle the problem in a few minutes.

You may also use these hours for custom development, additional features etc.

It's also possible to buy additional hours, and our premium members get a discount over average fee.

_Basic_ and _Personal_ doesn't contain any live credits.

_Professional_ level comes with 3 hours of live credits, while _Enterprise_ has 5 hours.

## Access to Full Source Code

All levels except _Basic_, provides access to _StartSharp_ GitHub repository with full source code.

## Expiration and Renewals

The packages you buy provide access to StartSharp repository, updates and premium support for a period of 12 months (except _Basic_).

Once that period ends, we won't auto renew your subscription and you'll receive an e-mail from us with a discounted renewal offer (usually around 25%).

If you choose to not renew, you'll only lose access to StartSharp source code, updates and premium support.

You'll be keeping your StartSharp licence and continue using versions of StartSharp released during your subscription period.

Your existing projects will continue to work, and you can still create new projects using your version of StartSharp.
